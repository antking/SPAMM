Still to do:

1) Decide on spectral components --> needs people who know components
-- Marianne (everything)
-- Gisella (everything but host galaxy)
-- Roberto (host galaxy)
-- Kelly (emission lines)
-- Matthias (Balmer continuum)
-- Kevin (host galaxy?)
-- Demitri (host galaxy and stellar pops)

2) Write spectral components --> needs people who can code
-- Gisella
-- Roberto
-- Demitri
-- Anna

----------------------------------
Tests that need to be done:

1) Simulated Data: test S/N, resolution, wavelength coverage, components
2) Real Data: test S/N, resolution, wavelength coverage, components (lines)
