We wish to publish a series of papers before making the code public.

Priorities:

1.) Method paper (Demitri)- describes the code, and tests:
    Tests:
    **simulated data:  - testing components
		       - dependence on: i)   S/N
					ii)  resolution
					iii) wavelength coverage
		       - number of, e.g., host/FeII components
    **Testing with real data (same tests as above)

2.) Application papers
    a) Xshooter Legacy sample (Kelly)
    b) SDSS (Marianne)
    c) Reverberation mapping Atlas (Gisella/Brad)
    d) Host Galaxy contribution (Roberto/Brad)
    e) Application of decomposed spectra in modeling RM (Anna)
    f) Please add more


***The initial thought is that these papers should largely go out
together if at all possible; the largest push will be to publish the
method paper and public release of the code with at least the papers
applying it to publically released data.

***Please add your own ideas to this file.

****Disclaimer: All workshop participants are to be co-authors on all
papers, so please keep the collaboration updated on ideas and progress.
